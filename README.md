<h2>&nbsp;<strong>What is Queue Up?</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Queue up is a discord bot designed to be used for "Tournament" servers or servers with a competitive feeling. This bot will allow a user to react to a message they desire to play in, then put them into a queue, waiting for another user to react. Once another user reacts, the bot will remove both users from the queue, then create a ticket located on the top of the server.</em></p>
